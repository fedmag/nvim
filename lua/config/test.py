    Class used to parse the file containing heroes and abilities.
    
    The class returns a dictionary like: { hero_name: [ability1, ...] }

    Attributes
    ----------
    filepath: str
        indicates the path from which the file must be read
    hero_dict: dict
        the dictionary that will be populated and then returned

    Methods
    ---------
    parse_file(filepath)
        main method that calls all the others and provides the end-to-end job
    clean_ability_descp_pair(line, hero_name)
        takes the line and extrapolate the ability given the hero name, ignoring useless lines given words
        appearing in the line
    clean_ability_name(line, hero_name)
        takes the line like: "DOTA_Tooltip_ability_templar_assassin_trap_Description" and gives back "trap"
    get_dictionary
        a dictionary like: { hero_name: [ability1, ...] }
    get_dictionary_JSON
        returns the hero_dictionary as a JSON string
